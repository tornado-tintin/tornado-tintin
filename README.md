### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tornado-tintin
 Iâ€™m interested in explaining and improving Tornado cash. I want to do this by trying to break tornado cash !
 - I graphed deposits and withdrawals across time for all pools from all the networks [here](https://tornadotintin.github.io/wbtc10pool.html)
 -  I took a closer look at a single pool: 10 wBTC [here](https://tornadotintin.github.io/usageGraphed.html).
 Playing with repeated users and sudden spikes of usage show some promising approaches.

- ðŸ“« Reach out to me on the [tornado forum](https://torn.community/u/tintin)
